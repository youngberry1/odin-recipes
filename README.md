Project Title: My First Webpage 

This is a beginner-level project built as part of my learning journey through The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to practice and reinforce foundational web development skills. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and possibly some JavaScript, as well as how to structure and style a web page.

Skills Demonstrated:

Basic HTML structure and tags
Styling with CSS, including layout and design principles
Understanding how to structure a simple webpage
Introduction to Git and GitHub for version control
Iâ€™m still in the early stages of my learning, and this project is a great opportunity to practice what I've learned so far and to reflect on how much progress I've made.
